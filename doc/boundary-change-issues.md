# boundary-change-issues

This page gives a rough guide to new, changing and dissappearing constituencies. Rough, because they don't always use the official names.

## Postcodes

(Issue created: https://github.com/swapmyvote/swapmyvote/issues/725 )

Current provider (api) is api.postcodes.io. That web pages says that they update based on ONS data, which we can be fairly certain will be late.

Postcode that should completely change (dissappearing -> new): OX26 2EW

Our current lookup (api.postcodes.io) gives Banbury

Electoral calculus gives: Bicester and Woodstock

https://12v.github.io/boundary-mapper/ gives Bicester and Woodstock

Postcode that is in a constituency that disappears:: LL57 1LH

Our lookup gives the old constituency: Arfon

Electoral calculus gives: Bangor Aberconwy

https://12v.github.io/boundary-mapper/ also gives Bangor Aberconwy
