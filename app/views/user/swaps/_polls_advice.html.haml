    Check the poll chart, looks like your swap may be supporting a safe win for #{party.name} which is already leading by
    = poll.marginal_score/100.0
    percent in the pools
  - else
    Check the poll chart, #{party.name} is trailing by
    = poll.marginal_score/100.0
    percent in the polls and may still lose despite your swap
