    &#10071 Looks like this swap could make a difference for #{party.name}, which is
    = lead_trail
    by
    = poll.marginal_score/100.0
    percent in the polls
  - elsif poll.signed_marginal_score.positive?
    Looks like this swap may be supporting a safe win for #{party.name} which is already leading by
    = poll.marginal_score/100.0
    percent in the pools
  - else
    #{party.name} is trailing by
    = poll.marginal_score/100.0
    percent in the polls and may still lose despite this swap
